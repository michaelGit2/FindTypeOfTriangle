# BDD
The project is made to performe a task of ntaking values from a uiser and returning a comment as to weather the 3 values form a triangle type or totally not form a triangle.
## The following are the conditions
1. Equilateral: All sides are equal.
2. Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
3. Scalene: No sides are equal. 
4.NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
